      As a <a class="underline-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NidIrL7av-EC&hl=en" target="_blank">researcher</a>, I have demonstrated abilities to effectively develop research plans that deliver accurate results and then convey those results to non-technical and culturally diverse audiences in global venues. As you can see from my resume and featured projects, I thrive in a team-based atmosphere where I use my strong critical thinking ability and facilitation capabilities to collectively generate ideas, analyze perspectives, and delve into insights to create novel solutions to achieve our project goal(s).

      I have extensive experience in instrument design, data analytics, data modeling, and synthetic/analytical chemistry. I have gained this experience through independent research projects under constrained budgets at three universities, where I worked to develop, test, and implement novel instruments, methods, and models to create solutions to a variety of scientific questions.
